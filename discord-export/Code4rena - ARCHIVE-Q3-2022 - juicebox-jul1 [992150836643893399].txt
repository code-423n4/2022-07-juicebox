Looking at the docs I can see that the contracts have already been deployed to mainnet, are differences and/or errors in the deployment also in-scope for the contest?


[07/05/2022 1:31 PM] jango420
if you find something wrong that affects the public's interest, I'll personally make sure you get paid for the contribution. not sure its formally in scope


[07/05/2022 1:32 PM] philogy
Ah ok, so outside of the scope for the contest but covered in the form of a bounty program üëå

function distributePayoutsOf(
    uint256 _projectId,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _currency,
    address _token,
    uint256 _minReturnedTokens,

  ) external virtual override returns (uint256 netLeftoverDistributionAmount) {
    _token; // Prevents unused var compiler and natspec complaints.

    return _distributePayoutsOf(_projectId, _amount, _currency, _minReturnedTokens, _memo);
  }

```
What is the benefit of having unused variables like `_token`?


[07/05/2022 2:56 PM] jango420
the benefit is that this is a standard that can be adhered to by terminals that manage multiple tokens. In which case the _token arg would specify which exactly should be distributed.


[07/05/2022 2:57 PM] jango420
in the case of the ETH terminal, obv this isnt needed since it only manages one token.


[07/05/2022 3:48 PM] jango420
note: Issues with the oracle price resolvers are also in scope.

I have no idea, taking way longer than expected. They announced the rewards for yield witch v2 first despite it being later, wondering what's taking so long too. Was my first contest so I'm waiting for the rewards before doing any more bc I want to see if it's worth the time


[08/19/2022 1:33 PM] minh___
I assume there was less participation and submissions for yield witch due to the lower prize pool, and also because there were other contests running at the same time iirc


[08/19/2022 6:25 PM] rokinot
plenty participated, but there was less code and a very low amount of vulnerabilities found

l think you just chill and wait for them to arrive in your wallet. The awards will be distributed on Polygon within the next 1-2 weeks, count from the date, when the awards were announced. :chefskiss:

I mean, basically as long as you own your private key you have access to it. No worries. I can get access to my address on any chain.
